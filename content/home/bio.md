I was born and raised in South Korea, but I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan by the time I finished college. I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Before my graduate studies, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), “The Google of South Korea.” I have enjoyed living in different places of the world and love working with people from various backgrounds.

I am a first-generation college student and came from a low-income background. I have fought a constant uphill battle to pursue my academic career. I am committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in computational social science through my research, teaching, and mentoring. 

When I do not write or code, I enjoy running and cooking. I learned almost everything I need to know about professionalism from reading Haruki Murakami's "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running."
