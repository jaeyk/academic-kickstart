I was born and raised in South Korea, but I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan by the time I finished college. I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Before my graduate studies, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), “The Google of South Korea.” I have enjoyed living in different places of the world and love working with people from various backgrounds.

I am a first-generation college student and grew up in a working-class family. My late father was a factory worker of 32 years at a paper mill, and my mother was a housekeeper. Despite their humble educational backgrounds, they loved and valued learning. My supportive parents and numerous mentors I have met throughout my academic career put me on the path to be where I am today. To pay forward the generosity I have received, I am committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in academia. I am happy to chat with students, especially those underrepresented in academia, regarding learning computational methods, applying to graduate schools and jobs, and building an academic career.

When I do not write or code, I enjoy running and cooking. I learned almost everything I need to know about professionalism from reading Haruki Murakami's [*What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.*](https://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir)
