I was born and raised in South Korea, but I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan by the time I finished college. I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Before my graduate studies, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), “The Google of South Korea.” 

I am a first-generation college student and grew up in a working-class family. My late father was a factory worker of 32 years at a paper mill, and my mother was a housekeeper. Yet, despite their humble educational backgrounds, they loved and valued learning. My supportive parents and numerous mentors put me on the path to be where I am today. To pay forward the generosity I have received, I am committed to increasing the pipeline of diverse talent in academia. 

When I do not write or code, I enjoy cooking and distance running (I love both road and trail running). I am also an avid reader and music enthusiast (blues, jazz, classical, and hip-hop).
