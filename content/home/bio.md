I was born and raised in South Korea, but I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan by the time I finished college. I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Before my graduate studies, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), “The Google of South Korea.” I have enjoyed living in different places of the world and love working with people from various backgrounds.

I am a first-generation college student and came from a low-income background. I have fought a constant uphill battle to pursue my academic career. I am committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in computational social science through my research, teaching, and mentoring. I am also happy to chat with students from any background interested in computational social science but have no idea how to break into this world. For general advice on an academic career, I recommend reading Jessica McCrory Calarco's [*A Field Guide to Grad School: Uncovering the Hidden Curriculum*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691201108/a-field-guide-to-grad-school) and Thomas M. Carsey's [*Advice about Graduate School, Finding a Job, Reaching Tenure in Political Science and other Social Sciences, and All of the Steps in Between*](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/186/2020/09/Toms-Comments-Carsey-book-9-7-2020.pdf).

When I do not write or code, I enjoy running and cooking. I learned almost everything I need to know about professionalism from reading Haruki Murakami's [*What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.*](https://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir) The following is my favorite quote from the book: "Exerting yourself to the fullest within your individual limits: that’s the essence of running, and a metaphor for life—and for me, for writing as well."
