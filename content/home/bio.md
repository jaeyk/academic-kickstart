I was born and raised in South Korea, but by the time I finished college, I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I moved to California in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to the States, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), "The Google of South Korea," as its youngest member at age 27. I also published a [popular-press book](https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=7842009) on how to get the best out of college (in Korean), which was sold more than 10,000 copies. I love to work with real and messy data, find rigorous and practical ways to analyze them and communicate results with visual illustrations and plain words. My passion is finding patterns and building tools.
