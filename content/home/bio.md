I was born and raised in South Korea, but by the time I finished college, I had also lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I moved to California in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to the States, I worked in the tech industry in South Korea. I was a strategy manager at a software startup and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), the Google of South Korea. I also published a [popular book](https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=7842009) on how to get the best out of college (in Korean), which was sold more than 10,000 copies. I love to work with real and messy data, find rigorous and practical ways to analyze them and communicate results with visual illustrations and plain words. My passion is finding patterns and building tools. In my spare time, I run outdoors, read technical books, listen all kinds of music, and cook homestyle Korean food.

Sometimes, I write personal essays on my work and life:

- ["What Runnig Taught Me: How to Fail and How to Grow Old"](/2020/07/20/what-running-taught-me/)

- ["Speaking of Speaking English"](/2020/06/09/speaking-of-speaking-english/)
