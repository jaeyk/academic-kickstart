I was born in a small town in South Korea, but by the time I finished college, I had lived in five cities in South Korea, and also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I moved to California in 2014 as a graduate student in political science at UC Berkeley. Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked at a software startup as a strategy manager and served on the advisory board of [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver), the Google of South Korea. I also wrote a [book](https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=7842009) on how to get the best out of college (in Korean), which was sold more than 10,000 copies in South Korea. I love to work with real and messy data, find rigorous and practical ways to analyze them and communicate results with visual illustrations and plain words. My passion is finding patterns and building tools. In my spare time, I run, read, and cook.
