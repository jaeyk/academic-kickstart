I believe in the power of collaboration. 

I have co-founded three interdisciplinary working groups and co-organized the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://sicss.io/2020/bay_area/), hosted by UC Berkeley and Stanford, all while in graduate school.

I have conducted research with 16 amazing people across social sciences and engineering, including faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students. The following is the list of their names and affiliations (ordered alphabetically). Please check out their websites to learn more about their research.
