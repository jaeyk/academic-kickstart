This original dataset traces the founding of Asian American and Latino community-based and advocacy organizations over the last century. The dataset includes about 299 Asian American and 519 Latino advocacy and community-based organizations. Each observation includes the organization title, the founding year, the physical address, and whether they operate as a community-based, an advocacy or a hybrid (active in both types of work) organization. Source materials were mainly collected from the following four databases: the Encyclopedia of Associations – National Organizations of the U.S., the Encyclopedia of Associations – Regional, State, and Local Organizations of the U.S., the National Directory of Nonprofit Organizations, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics. The funding information comes from Foundation Directory Online, which has compiled data from all 140,000 U.S. philanthropic foundations (2003-2017) and federal agencies (2014-2017). (2019-12-07)
