I am a computational social scientist studying the politics of identity among marginalized populations. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Political Science at UC Berkeley in May 2020, where I was a Senior Data Science Fellow at D-Lab. I will be an Assistant Research Scholar at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University between July and December 2021. In 2022, I will join the KDI School of Public Policy and Management as an Assistant Professor of Data Science.

My research agenda is interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of social sciences and data science. My current research interests are divided into two streams: (1) data science for social science and (2) social science for data science. For the first research line, I use data science to scale up research on civic and political engagement, organizing, and mobilization among marginalized populations. I am also interested in applying a data-driven approach to improve survey and experimental design. For the second research line, I use social science to detect and reduce bias in automated decision systems. My dissertation examines the politics of solidarity in multiracial America, and my other research concerns political behavior in the U.S. and beyond.

My research has been published or forthcoming in academic journals and conference proceedings, including *Political Research Quarterly*, *Studies in American Political Development*, *Journal of Computational Social Science*, and *ICWSM*. My research has also appeared in popular outlets such as the *Washington Post's Monkey Cage*. I am the recipient of the Western Political Science Association's 2020 [Don T. Nakanishi Award](https://www.wpsanet.org/award/) for distinguished scholarship in Asian Pacific American Politics. 
 
I am also a research software developer and data science educator. I have either developed or co-developed five R packages for computationally intensive social science research. I have taught computational social science at both graduate and undergraduate levels in semester-long courses and short workshops. I am currently working on an open textbook project titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/)
