I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and a [D-Lab Senior Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) at UC Berkeley and a [Visiting Student Fellow](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/people/graduate-student-fellows/) at the SNF Agora Institute's P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University. 

As a computational social scientist, my research agenda is interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of social sciences and data science. My current research interests are divided into two streams: (1) data science for social science and (2) social science for data science.  

**Data Science for Social Science**

I am currently working with [Hahrie Han](https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/hahrie-han/) and [Milan de Vries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-de-vries-567b7376) to develop a big data infrastructure for studying political organizing in the U.S. I applied machine learning to large-scale text data to examine [how social exclusion shapes Asian American partisanship](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dvm7r/) and [how threats influence political learning among marginalized populations](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y65sd/).

**Social Science for Data Science**

My audit study on [intersectional bias in hate speech and abusive language datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05921) appears in *Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media, Data Challenge Workshop (ICWSM '20)*. I also have two ongoing projects (a behavioral study and an invited book chapter) on online hate speech. 

**Dissertation Research** 

My dissertation examines how government policies influenced U.S. minority coalition formation in the 1960s and 1970s. This project won WPSA's Don T. Nakanishi Award for Distinguished Scholarship and Service in Asian Pacific American Politics. Portions of this work appear in [*Studies in American Political Development*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/racism-is-not-enough-minority-coalition-building-in-san-francisco-seattle-and-vancouver/7557642023E744D2E0FA68D800C8E08E), [*Political Research Quarterly*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1065912920983456) and the [*Journal of Computational Social Science*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-020-00097-2).

**Other Research** 

My other research focuses on political behavior of racial minorities in the U.S. and attitude toward immigrants and refugees in East Asia.

**Research Software** 

I authored or co-authored and maintain [six R packages](https://github.com/jaeyk) for parsing large and complex data (tweets, newspaper articles, tax forms, websites, etc.) and making research computationally reproducible. 

**Teaching Computational Social Science** 

I have taught computational social science at both graduate and undergraduate levels in semester-long courses and short workshops. I also served as a [Data Science Education Program Fellow](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/skills/5-principles-to-get-undergraduates-involved-in-real-world-data-science-projects) at UC Berkeley and co-organized the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/bay-sicss-bridging-computational-social-scientists-and-practitioners-social-good). I am currently working on an open textbook project titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/)
