I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and a [D-Lab Senior Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) at UC Berkeley and a [Visiting Student Fellow](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/people/graduate-student-fellows/) at the SNF Agora Institute's P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University. I study political learning, organizing, and mobilization among marginalized populations using big data and data science. I also build tools that make social science research more efficient and reproducible. 

**Ongoing Research**

I am currently working with [Hahrie Han](https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/hahrie-han/) and [Milan de Vries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-de-vries-567b7376) on Mapping the Modern Agora project that develops infrastructure for automatically collecting, parsing, and organizing data on civic organizations in the US based on more than three million tax reports. 

**Dissertation Research** 

My dissertation examines how government policies influenced U.S. minority coalition formation in the 1960s and 1970s. This project won WPSA's Don T. Nakanishi Award for Distinguished Scholarship and Service in Asian Pacific American Politics. Portions of this work appear (or forthcoming) in [*Studies in American Political Development*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/racism-is-not-enough-minority-coalition-building-in-san-francisco-seattle-and-vancouver/7557642023E744D2E0FA68D800C8E08E), [*Political Research Quarterly*](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n83xs/) and the [*Journal of Computational Social Science*](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pg3aq/).

**Other Research** 

My research on [intersectional bias in hate speech and abusive language datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05921) appears in *Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), Data Challenge Workshop*. I also have working papers (under review) on [how threats influence political learning among marginalized populations](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y65sd/) and [how social exclusion shapes Asian American partisanship](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dvm7r/). 

**Research Software** 

I authored and maintain three R packages: [tidytweetjson](https://jaeyk.github.io/tidytweetjson/), [tidyethnicnews](https://jaeyk.github.io/tidyethnicnews/), and [makereproducible](https://jaeyk.github.io/makereproducible/)

**Teaching Computational Social Science** 

I am a proud recipient of the "Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award" and have taught computational social science at both graduate and undergraduate levels in semester-long courses and short workshops. I also served as a [Data Science Education Program Fellow](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/skills/5-principles-to-get-undergraduates-involved-in-real-world-data-science-projects) at UC Berkeley and co-organized the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/bay-sicss-bridging-computational-social-scientists-and-practitioners-social-good). I am currently working on an open textbook project titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/)

**Contact Me**

I love getting emails. 

[jaeyeonkim@berkeley.edu](mailto:jaeyeonkim@berkeley.edu).

I am on the job market this year and will graduate in May 2021.
