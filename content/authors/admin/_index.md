I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and a [D-Lab Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) at UC Berkeley. I co-organized [the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://compsocialscience.github.io/summer-institute/2020/bay_area/) and co-founded [the Berkeley Historical Social Science Workshop](https://github.com/jaeyk/hssw).

I study the politics of identity and inequality in the US, Canada, and East Asia using administrative, organizational, newspaper, social media, survey, and experimental data. My multi-methods dissertation examines how policies influenced minority coalition building in the US in the era of civil rights. This project won WPSA's Don T. Nakanishi Award for Distinguished Scholarship and Service in Asian Pacific American Politics. Portions of this work are published in [*Studies in American Political Development*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/racism-is-not-enough-minority-coalition-building-in-san-francisco-seattle-and-vancouver/7557642023E744D2E0FA68D800C8E08E/share/acc3d5f2d658e9ab2b3af76a69ab40dd510702c8). My research on bias in machine learning applications appears in [*Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), Data Challenge Workshop*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05921). I also developed and maintain three R packages: [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson), [tidyethnicnews](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidyethnicnews), and [makereproducible](https://github.com/jaeyk/makereproducible)

I am a proud recipient of the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award. I teach computational social science at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, including semester-long courses and short workshops. I also served as a [Data Science Education Program Fellow](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/skills/5-principles-to-get-undergraduates-involved-in-real-world-data-science-projects) for the Discovery Program at UC Berkeley.  

Please feel free to contact me via email at [jaeyeonkim@berkeley.edu](mailto:jaeyeonkim@berkeley.edu). As Paul Erd≈ës said, my brain is open!
