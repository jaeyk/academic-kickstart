I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and a [D-Lab Senior Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) at UC Berkeley and a [Visiting Student Fellow](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/people/graduate-student-fellows/) at the SNF Agora Institute's P3 Lab at Johns Hopkins University.

As a computational social scientist, my research agenda is interdisciplinary and lies at the intersection of social sciences and data science. My current research interests are divided into two streams: (1) data science for social science and (2) social science for data science. For the first research line, I use big data and machine learning to study how marginalized groups learn about and participate in politics. For the second research line, I use social science to investigate bias and fairness in machine learning applications. My dissertation examines the politics of solidarity in multiracial America, and my other research concerns political behavior in the U.S. and beyond. 

My research has been published or is forthcoming in journals and conference proceedings including *Political Research Quarterly*, *Studies in American Political Development*, *Journal of Computational Social Science*, and *Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), Data Challenge Workshop*. I am the recipient of the Western Political Science Association's 2020 [Don T. Nakanishi Award](https://www.wpsanet.org/award/) for distinguished scholarship in Asian Pacific American Politics. 
 
I am also a research software developer and data science educator. I have either developed or co-developed six R packages for computationally intensive social science research. I have taught computational social science at both graduate and undergraduate levels in semester-long courses and short workshops. I am currently working on an open textbook project titled ["Computational Thinking for Social Scientists."](https://jaeyk.github.io/PS239T/)
