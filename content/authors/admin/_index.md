I am a PhD candidate in Political Science and a [Senior D-Lab Data Science Fellow](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jae-yeon-kim) at UC Berkeley. I study political learning, organizing, and mobilization among marginalized populations using data science. I also build tools that make digital data collection easier and faster.

**Dissertation Research** 

My dissertation provides an original large-scale dataset and research software that enable data-intensive historical research on the politics of racial and ethnic minority groups. This project won WPSA's Don T. Nakanishi Award for Distinguished Scholarship and Service in Asian Pacific American Politics. Portions of this work are published in *Studies in American Political Development* and conditionally accepted at the *Journal of Computational Social Science*. 

**Other Research** 

My research on bias in machine learning applications appears in *Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM), Data Challenge Workshop*. 

**Research Software** 

I authored and maintain two R packages: [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson) and [tidyethnicnews](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidyethnicnews)

**Teaching Computational Social Science** 

I am a proud recipient of the "Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award" and have taught computational social science at both graduate and undergraduate levels in semester-long courses and short workshops. I have served as a [Data Science Education Program Fellow](https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/skills/5-principles-to-get-undergraduates-involved-in-real-world-data-science-projects) at UC Berkeley and advised more than 40 applied data science projects, working with community partners and undergraduate students. I also co-organized the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/bay-sicss-bridging-computational-social-scientists-and-practitioners-social-good) with a thematic focus on using computational social science for social good.
