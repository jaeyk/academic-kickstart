abstract = "Survey research has been central to studying racial and ethnic politics in the US. However, most of these surveys were developed in the 1990s and 2000s, so they are not useful if researchers are interested in historical questions. The text-as-data approach provides a solution to this problem by turning ethnic newspaper articles into data. In this study, I present a mixed-method framework that combines a case selection strategy, content analysis, and text classification to utilize a large collection of ethnic newspaper articles for descriptive inference. As a demonstration of this framework, I apply machine learning techniques to 78,383 articles from Asian American and African American newspapers from the 1960s through the 1980s. Content analysis assesses data quality by measuring what and how human coders label the training data. Text classification demonstrates that Asian American newspapers issued linked progress articles by 110% more than African American newspapers did. By contrast, African American newspapers produced linked hurt articles by 133% more than Asian American newspapers did. The gap between the two groups widened up to 10 times when the training data were measured by the minimum rather than the maximum threshold."
