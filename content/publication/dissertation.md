abstract = "My dissertation focuses on how government policies influence minority coalition formation in the U.S. in the era of civil rights. The main subjects of the dissertation are community organizers in minority communities, as they were directly involved in coalition-building efforts during this watershed period in U.S. history. In three chapters, my dissertation attempts to understand when these community organizers have strategic incentives to form intra- and inter-racial coalitions by demonstrating the connections between policy changes and the changes in these actorsâ€™ strategic thinking."
