abstract = "Automating text analysis brings large-scale text data into historical social science research. This feature is especially attractive to the field of racial and ethnic politics, in which historical quantitative data are rare. My integrated text classification framework argues that this computational approach produces more credible outcomes when researchers pay careful attention to humansâ€™ role in the machine learning pipeline. The quality of human-coded training data influences the performance and interpretation of machine-coded corpora. I support this argument with an analysis of political issues that appeared in 78,383 articles from Asian American and African American newspapers issued from the 1960s through the 1980s. Asian American newspapers focused on promoting collective gains more often than African American newspapers. Conversely, African American newspapers concentrated on preventing collective losses more than Asian American newspapers. The misalignment of political agendas between the two corpora widened up to 10 times when the training data were measured using the minimum, rather than the maximum, reliability threshold."
