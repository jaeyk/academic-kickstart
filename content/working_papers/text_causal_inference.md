abstract = "This study uses a natural experiment and machine learning to examine how threats shift immigrants' political attention from their home country to host society. We trace how the September 11 attacks, an exogenous shock, increased Arab and Indian Americans' interest in U.S. domestic politics. We classified 5,684 Arab American and Indian American newspaper articles using machine learning. We estimated that three more articles on U.S. domestic politics were published daily in the post-9/11 period than in previous years. We found that the intervention produced a 46% smaller effect among the host population by analyzing 23,086 New York Times articles. The findings demonstrate how threats shift the locus of targeted immigrant groups' political attention."
